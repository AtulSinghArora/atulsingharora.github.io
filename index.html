<p>I am a researcher at IIIT Hyderabad, India, working as an Assistant
Professor. I am fascinated by the emergence of physical insight from the
application of quantum mechanics to solving computational or
cryptographic tasks. I was initially drawn to the field by the
possibility of having information theoretic security in certain
cryptographic settings. Currently, I am excited by the prospect of
understanding and testing various aspects of quantum physics under
computational assumptions.</p>

<p>I spent a year as a Hartree fellow (postdoctoral position) at the <a
href="https://quics.umd.edu/people/atul-singh-arora">University of
Maryland</a>. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a
href="https://iqim.caltech.edu/people/postdocs/">Caltech</a>, under the
supervision of Prof Thomas VIDICK. For my doctoral dissertation (Sep
2020), I was advised by Prof Jérémie ROLAND at <a
href="http://quic.ulb.ac.be/members/past">Université libre de
Bruxelles</a>. I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s (May 2016) from <a

<blockquote>
<p>Bell non-locality is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics
whereby measurements performed on “spatially separated” quantum systems
can exhibit correlations that cannot be understood as revealing
predetermined values. This is a special case of the more general
phenomenon of “quantum contextuality”, which says that such correlations
can occur even when the measurements are not necessarily on separate
quantum systems, but are merely “compatible” (i.e. commuting).
Crucially, while any non-local game yields an experiment that
demonstrates quantum advantage by leveraging the “spatial separation” of
two or more devices (and in fact several such demonstrations have been
conducted successfully in recent years), the same is not true for
quantum contextuality: finding the contextuality analogue of such an
experiment is arguably one of the central open questions in the
foundations of quantum mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In this work, we show that an arbitrary contextuality game can be
compiled into an operational “test of contextuality” involving a single
quantum device, by only making the assumption that the device is
computationally bounded. Our work is inspired by the recent work of
Kalai et al. (STOC ’23) that converts any non-local game into a
classical test of quantum advantage with a single device. The central
idea in their work is to use cryptography to enforce spatial separation
within subsystems of a single quantum device. Our work can be seen as
using cryptography to enforce “temporal separation”, i.e. to restrict
communication between sequential measurements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond contextuality, we employ our ideas to design a “proof of
quantumness” that, to the best of our knowledge, is arguably even
simpler than the ones proposed in the literature so far.</p>

<p>Weak coin flipping is the cryptographic task where Alice and Bob
remotely flip a coin but want opposite outcomes. This work studies this
task in the device-independent regime where Alice and Bob neither trust
each other, nor their quantum devices. The best protocol was devised
over a decade ago by Silman, Chailloux, Aharon, Kerenidis, Pironio, and
Massar with bias <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon \approx
0.33664\)</span>, where the bias is a commonly adopted security measure
for coin flipping protocols. This work presents two techniques to lower
the bias of such protocols, namely self-testing and abort-phobic
compositions. We apply these techniques to the SCAKPM ’11 protocol above
and, assuming a continuity conjecture, lower the bias to <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon \approx 0.29104\)</span>. We believe
that these techniques could be useful in the design of
device-independent protocols for a variety of other tasks.</p>

how one can test <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> out of <span

of the remaining device, for later use in the protocol. The proof uses

<p>Self-testing allows for characterising quantum systems under minimal
assumptions. However, existing schemes rely on quantum non-locality and
cannot be applied to systems that are not entangled. Here, we introduce
a robust method that achieves self-testing of individual systems by
taking advantage of contextuality. The scheme is based on the simplest
contextuality witness for the simplest contextual quantum system—the
Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky inequality for the qutrit. We
establish a lower bound on the fidelity of the state and the
measurements as a function of the value of the witness under a pragmatic
assumption on the measurements. We apply the method in an experiment on
a single trapped <span class="math inline">\(^{40}{\rm Ca}^+\)</span>
and using randomly chosen measurements and perfect detection efficiency.
Using the observed statistics, we obtain the first experimental
demonstration of self-testing of a single quantum system with negligible
deviations from the assumptions.</p>

<p>We give a comprehensive characterisation of the computational power
of shallow quantum circuits combined with classical computation.
Specifically, for classes of search problems, we show that the following
statements hold, relative to a random oracle:<br />
(a) <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}}} \neq
\mathsf{BQP}\)</span>. This refutes Jozsa’s conjecture [QIP 05] in the
random oracle model. As a result, this gives the first instantiatable
separation between the classes by replacing the oracle with a
cryptographic hash function, yielding a resolution to one of Aaronson’s
ten semi-grand challenges in quantum computing.<br />
(b) <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}} \nsubseteq
\mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}} \nsubseteq
\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}}\)</span>. This shows that there is a subtle
interplay between classical computation and shallow quantum computation.
In fact, for the second separation, we establish that, for some
problems, the ability to perform adaptive measurements in a single
shallow quantum circuit, is more useful than the ability to perform
polynomially many shallow quantum circuits without adaptive
measurements.<br />
(c) There exists a 2-message proof of quantum depth protocol. Such a
protocol allows a classical verifier to efficiently certify that a
prover must be performing a computation of some minimum quantum depth.
Our proof of quantum depth can be instantiated using the recent proof of
quantumness construction by Yamakawa and Zhandry [FOCS 22].</p>

<p>Weak coin flipping is an important cryptographic primitive, as it is
the strongest known secure two-party computation primitive, that
classically becomes secure only when certain assumptions are made
(e.g. computational hardness), while quantumly there exist protocols
that achieve arbitrarily close to perfect security. This breakthrough
result was established by C. Mochon in 2007 [arXiv:0711.4114], however,
his proof of existence was partially non-constructive, thus, setting
back the proposal of explicit protocols. In this work, we report three
different solutions to the quantum weak coin flipping problem. In
particular, we propose different methods that result—either analytically
or numerically—in the operators needed to construct weak coin flipping
protocols with different levels of security, including nearly perfect
security. In order to develop these methods, we study the quantum weak
coin flipping problem from both an algebraic and a geometric
perspective. We also analytically construct illustrative examples of
weak coin flipping protocols achieving different levels of security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An important theoretical problem in the study of quantum computation,
that is also practically relevant in the context of near-term quantum
devices, is to understand the computational power of hybrid models, that
combine polynomial-time classical computation with short-depth quantum
computation. Here, we consider two such models: CQ_d which captures the
scenario of a polynomial-time classical algorithm that queries a d-depth
quantum computer many times; and QC_d which is more analogous to
measurement-based quantum computation and captures the scenario of a
d-depth quantum computer with the ability to change the sequence of
gates being applied depending on measurement outcomes processed by a
classical computation. Chia, Chung and Lai (STOC 2020) and Coudron and
Menda (STOC 2020) showed that these models (with d=polylog(n)) are
strictly weaker than BQP (the class of problems solvable by
polynomial-time quantum computation), relative to an oracle, disproving
a conjecture of Jozsa in the relativised world.<br />
In this paper, we show that, despite the similarities between CQ_d and
QC_d, the two models are incomparable, i.e. CQ_d ⊈ QC_d and QC_d ⊈ CQ_d
relative to an oracle. In other words, we show that there exist problems
that one model can solve but not the other and vice versa. We do this by
considering new oracle problems that capture the distinctions between
the two models and by introducing the notion of an intrinsically
stochastic oracle, an oracle whose responses are inherently randomised,
which is used for our second result. While we leave showing the second
separation relative to a standard oracle as an open problem, we believe
the notion of stochastic oracles could be of independent interest for
studying complexity classes which have resisted separation in the
standard oracle model. Our constructions also yield simpler oracle
separations between the hybrid models and BQP, compared to earlier
works.</p>

<p>Weak coin flipping (WCF) is a fundamental cryptographic primitive for
two-party secure computation, where two distrustful parties need to
remotely establish a shared random bit whilst having opposite preferred
outcomes. It is the strongest known primitive with arbitrarily close to
perfect security quantumly while classically, its security is completely
compromised (unless one makes further assumptions, such as computational
hardness). A WCF protocol is said to have bias <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> if neither party can force their
preferred outcome with probability greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1/2+\epsilon\)</span>. Classical WCF protocols are
shown to have bias <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>, i.e., a
cheating party can always force their preferred outcome. On the other
hand, there exist quantum WCF protocols with arbitrarily small bias, as
Mochon showed in his seminal work in 2007 [arXiv:0711.4114]. In
particular, he proved the existence of a family of WCF protocols
approaching bias <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon
(k)=1/(4k+2)\)</span> for arbitrarily large <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and proposed a protocol with bias <span
class="math inline">\(1/6\)</span>. Last year, Arora, Roland and Weis
presented a protocol with bias <span class="math inline">\(1/10\)</span>
and to go below this bias, they designed an algorithm that
<em>numerically</em> constructs unitary matrices corresponding to WCF
protocols with arbitrarily small bias [STOC’19, p.205-216]. In this
work, we present new techniques which yield a fully analytical
construction of WCF protocols with bias arbitrarily close to zero, thus
achieving a solution that has been missing for more than a decade.
Furthermore, our new techniques lead to a simplified proof of existence
of WCF protocols by circumventing the non-constructive part of Mochon’s
proof. As an example, we illustrate the construction of a WCF protocol
with bias <span class="math inline">\(1/14\)</span>.</p>

<p>Contextuality is one way of capturing the non-classicality of quantum
theory. The contextual nature of a theory is often witnessed via the
violation of non-contextuality inequalities—certain linear inequalities
involving probabilities of measurement events. Using the exclusivity
graph approach (one of the two main graph theoretic approaches for
studying contextuality), it was shown [PRA 88, 032104 (2013); Annals of
mathematics, 51-299 (2006)] that a necessary and sufficient condition
for witnessing contextuality is the presence of an odd number of events
(greater than three) which are either cyclically or anti-cyclically
exclusive. Thus, the non-contextuality inequalities whose underlying
exclusivity structure is as stated, either cyclic or anti-cyclic, are
fundamental to quantum theory. We show that there is a unique
non-contextuality inequality for each non-trivial cycle and anti-cycle.
In addition to the foundational interest, we expect this to aid the
understanding of contextuality as a resource to quantum computing and
its applications to local self-testing.</p>
