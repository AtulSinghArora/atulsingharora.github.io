  title       = {A simple proof of uniqueness of the KCBS inequality},
  abstract    = {Bell's investigation into the foundations of quantum mechanics revealed that its completion can not be given by a local model. A related property, that of non-contextuality, requires the completion to assign values to each quantum observable without it depending on the context, i.e. the set of observables it is measured with. An interesting generalisation of the Bell non-locality statement is that the completion can not be non-contextual if we impose a notion of exclusivity, known as the E-principle. The KCBS inequality may be considered an analogue of Bell-inequality and is used to probe contextuality. We show that the KCBS inequality is the only non-trivial facet defining non-contextuality inequality in the odd n-cycle contextuality scenario within the exclusivity graph approach. This is in contrast with the exponential number of facet-defining inequalities one obtains using the compatibility hypergraph approach, another major graph theoretic technique applied in this area. Our result entails that the KCBS inequality can be thought of as the unique hyperplane cutting through the polytope of all E-principle behaviours (analogous to the no-signalling polytope) uniquely in two parts, namely non-contextual and contextual. We discuss how this drastic simplification has interesting consequences and is expected to pave the path for a deeper understanding of the topic.},

  title       = {Quantum Weak Coin Flipping},
  abstract    = {We investigate weak coin flipping, a fundamental cryptographic primitive where two distrustful parties need to remotely establish a shared random bit. A cheating player can try to bias the output bit towards a preferred value. For weak coin flipping the players have known opposite preferred values. A weak coin-flipping protocol has a bias $\epsilon$ if neither player can force the outcome towards their preferred value with probability more than $\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon$. While it is known that classically $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$, Mochon showed in 2007 [arXiv:0711.4114] that quantumly weak coin flipping can be achieved with arbitrarily small bias (near perfect) but the best known explicit protocol has bias 1/6 (also due to Mochon, 2005 [Phys. Rev. A 72, 022341]). We propose a framework to construct new explicit protocols achieving biases beyond 1/6. In particular, we construct explicit unitaries for protocols with bias up to 1/10. To go beyond, we introduce what we call the Elliptic Monotone Align (EMA) algorithm which, together with the framework, allows us to construct protocols with arbitrarily small biases. This solves the open problem of quantum weak coin flipping (in the absence of noise).},
