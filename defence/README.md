### Acknowledgements

I am thankful to Jérémie for being the wonderful boss, mentor and person that he is. Nicolas for his careful examination of the thesis and all the corrections he meticulously listed conveyed. 

I thank Zac and Célia for helping me with the translation. I am grateful to Célia for helping me with the dreaded MS Teams. I thank Michael for helping me with the chocolates and to Uttam for helping me with the live streaming process. I am thankful to Pascale for all the help with the organisation of the event. And of course, all the jury members for taking the time to assess my work—Stafano Pironio, Samuel Fiorini, André Chailloux and Peter Høyer.

I'm thankful to everyone at QuIC and all of my friends and my family and my relatives who took the time and joined me (and those who couldn't). You made the day extremely special, warm, encouraging and memorable. I know the streaming was far from perfect. I hope the recorded video is some consolation.
